# K-means-for-color-compression

## Modeling objective
- Use K-means to cluster the pixels of a photograph based on their encoded color values. 
- Explore how different values of _k_ affect the clustering of the pixels, and thus the appearance of the photograph. 
- Evaluate the results of the K-means clustering using the elbow method and silhouette scores.
- Also, explore a bit about density-based spatial clustering (DBSCAN) and agglomerative clustering.
